# First Post

This post has no layout specified, so it will default to `templates/layouts/default-layout`

It's just Markdown, compiled by the `marked` npm package.

This is your **very first**  post!!

  * item 1
     * item 1.a
  * item 2

You can write code with highlighting, hightlighted styling in `src/styles/_syntax.scss`.


```javascript
function add(a,b) {
   return a+b;
}
```
