# Third Post

This post has an explicit layout defined that is different than the default `post-layout`.

Also, it has `status: "publish"` in the front matter, so this post would appear in the production version
of the site.

It will show an extra `<h1>` tag no present in the default layout - just for demonstration, obviously!
